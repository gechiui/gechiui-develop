# E2E TestsEnd-To-End (E2E) tests for GeChiUI.## Running the testsThe e2e tests require a production-like environment to run. By default, they will assume an environment is available at `http://localhost:8899`, with username=admin and password=password.If you don't already have an environment ready, you can set one up by following [these instructions](https://github.com/GeChiUI/gechiui-develop/blob/master/README.md).Then you can launch the tests by running:```npm run test:e2e```which will run the test suite using a headless browser.If your environment has a different url, username or password to the default, you can provide the base URL, username and password like this:```npm run test:e2e -- --gechiui-base-url=http://mycustomurl --gechiui-username=username --gechiui-password=password```**DO NOT run these tests in an actual production environment, as they will delete all your content.**For debugging purposes, you might want to follow the test visually. You can do so by running the tests in an interactive mode.```npm run test:e2e -- --puppeteer-interactive```You can also run a single test file separately:```npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/specs/hello.test.js```## Documentation* Block Editor Handbook end to end testing overview: https://developer.gechiui.com/block-editor/contributors/code/testing-overview/#end-to-end-testing* Gutenberg e2e-test-utils package API docs: https://github.com/GeChiUI/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/e2e-test-utils* Puppeteer API docs: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#readme (the version we are using is indicated in the @gechiui/scripts package: https://github.com/GeChiUI/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/scripts/package.json)
